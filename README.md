## 💡 About Me

I'm a **Jordanian software engineer** and **founder of Learnify**, a next-generation AI-powered learning platform.  
I specialize in building **scalable, real-time, and AI-integrated web apps** that bridge the gap between education and industry.

I focus on creating products that **work beautifully, perform reliably, and solve real-world problems.**  
Currently building tools that empower creators, educators, and founders across the MENA region.
